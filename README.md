# Surprise Pages

> **Discovery-platform branch:** the original Surprise Page builders and
> materials are preserved. The homepage now prototypes an India-first gift
> discovery experience with a Three.js gift universe, responsive CSS fallback,
> working occasion/style/budget filters, saved items, evidence-led Trust
> Passports, seller-pilot entry point, and Surprise Pages as the post-discovery
> add-on. Catalogue entries are visibly marked as samples until real sellers
> consent and complete verification.

Self-serve builder for personalised one-page "surprise" gift links —
birthdays, anniversaries, everyday surprises. India-first (₹ pricing,
Razorpay). Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase.

## Tiers

| Tier | Price | What it is | Fulfillment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Simple Wish | ₹99 | One message, one card | Self-serve (`/builder`) or manual |
| 2 — Memory Lane | ₹199 | Scrollable photo + caption sequence | Self-serve (`/builder/tier2`) or manual |
| 3 — Time Capsule | ₹299 | Countdown lock, petal-reveal animation | Self-serve (`/builder/tier3`) or manual |
| 4 — White Glove | From ₹999 | Fully custom | Manual only (`/builder/white-glove`) |

Every tier now has **two fulfillment paths**, not just one:

- **Self-serve ("DIY"):** fill the real builder form → live preview updates
  as you type → pay → page auto-publishes at `/p/[slug]`, no one involved.
- **Manual ("build it for me"):** a much shorter form — just recipient name
  + your email, everything else optional — submits a brief instead of a
  finished config. No payment, no auto-publish. It saves to Supabase and
  emails the owner (via Resend); the owner builds and delivers the page by
  hand. Reachable as a secondary CTA on every self-serve builder, and as
  the only path for Tier 4.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Supabase + Razorpay + Resend + admin keys
```

**Database**: apply migrations in order using the Supabase SQL editor (or
your preferred migration tool). Each file in `supabase/migrations/` is
numbered and self-contained — run them in sequence:

```
supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql   ← orders + manual_requests tables
supabase/migrations/002_rate_limit_buckets.sql
supabase/migrations/003_admin_actions.sql
supabase/migrations/004_order_owners.sql          ← customer account dashboard
supabase/migrations/005_private_page_tokens.sql   ← secure recipient URLs
```

`supabase/schema.sql` is an auto-generated snapshot of the cumulative state
— useful as a quick reference, but do not apply it on top of individual
migrations. Edit only the migration files, not the snapshot.

**Environment variables** — copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
- `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only Supabase client
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — browser/middleware client (safe to expose)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — full origin used when constructing magic-link redirect URLs (no trailing slash)
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` + `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` + `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_TO_EMAIL` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (optional — manual requests still save without it)
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` — comma-separated emails to promote to admin role via `scripts/grant-admin.mjs`
- `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` — receives urgent content-report notifications

To grant a signed-in user admin access, set `ADMIN_EMAILS` and run:

```bash
npm run grant-admin
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Register a webhook in the Razorpay dashboard pointing at
`https://yourdomain/api/webhooks/razorpay` for the `payment.captured` event.

**Note:** building inside a network-restricted sandbox will fail on the
`next/font/google` fetch — that's expected, not a real bug; Vercel's build
servers have full internet access. Use `npx tsc --noEmit` as the reliable
check in a restricted environment.

## Self-serve flow

1. Builder page (client form) → `POST /api/orders` → draft order saved,
   slug generated
2. `POST /api/orders/[slug]/pay` → Razorpay order created, Checkout widget
   opens (price looked up server-side from the template registry, never
   trusted from the client)
3. User pays → Checkout returns payment fields to the browser →
   `POST /api/verify-payment` verifies Razorpay's HMAC signature server-side
   before marking the order `published`. Razorpay's signed
   `POST /api/webhooks/razorpay` is also configured as a reliable asynchronous
   confirmation path.
4. `/p/[slug]?pin=XXXX` → server component fetches the order, checks the
   PIN, renders it through the template registry

## Manual ("build it for me") flow

1. Shared `ManualRequestForm` (recipient name + contact email required,
   everything else optional) → `POST /api/manual-requests`
2. The manual-request module saves the request to Supabase first, always —
   then best-effort notifies the owner. A missing/broken notifier can
   never cause a lead to be lost; it just falls back to a console log.
3. Owner reads the `manual_requests` table (or their email, once Resend
   env vars are set), builds the page by hand, sends it to the sender
   directly. No automation past step 2 — that's intentional.

## Project structure

Simple by purpose: `app/` contains routes and thin HTTP handlers,
`components/` contains all UI, and `lib/` contains small direct server-side
modules for orders, payments, email, and Supabase.

```
src/
  app/                      # routes only (App Router)
    (site)/                 # everything under the shared marketing Nav
      layout.tsx            #   <Nav> + font variables
      page.tsx              #   landing page (composes marketing components)
      landing.css           #   autumn/painterly landing theme (.sp-*)
      builder/              #   self-serve builders (tiers 1-3 + white-glove)
      terms/  refunds/      #   policy pages
    p/[slug]/               # delivered gift page (PIN-gated, no Nav)
    api/                    # order / manual-request / payment endpoints
    layout.tsx  globals.css # root shell + shared paper-theme utilities
  components/
    marketing/              # landing page sections, effects, UI, and content
    builders/                # Tier1-3 builder forms
    templates/               # Tier1-3 live-page renderers
    gift/                    # PIN entry
    Nav.tsx  ManualRequestForm.tsx
  lib/                      # direct server modules: orders, payments, email,
                            #   Supabase, validation, template registry
  types/                    # shared TypeScript contracts
```

Imports use the `@/*` alias (→ `src/*`) throughout, so route files can point
directly at the component or helper they use.

## Keeping the code simple

The app uses direct, typed functions instead of service classes, repository
interfaces, and a composition root. For example, API handlers call
`createOrder`, `getOrder`, and `publishOrder` from `lib/orders.ts`; that module
contains the Supabase queries and the small amount of order-specific logic.

This keeps a typical change to one or two files while preserving the important
boundaries: route handlers parse HTTP requests, `lib` owns server integrations,
and `components` owns UI. The template registry remains the single place that
maps a tier to its price and renderer.

## Design system

Near-black canvas with a single warm orange → pink → purple accent
gradient, used sparingly (CTAs, the "Popular" badge, one highlighted
phrase per section) — everything else stays monochrome. Inter for
display/body, IBM Plex Mono for small uppercase labels. Landing-page
motion (scroll-reveal, hero blobs/petals, hover-lift, CTA sheen) is
routed through a handful of shared keyframes/utilities in `globals.css`
rather than one-off animations per section, and all of it respects
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Known gaps to close before real launch

- Razorpay isn't configured in production yet (env vars unset, pending
  KYC) — self-serve order creation works, but paying will 500 until
  that's done. Deliberate placeholder, not a bug.
- No real photo upload — builders currently take raw photo URLs.
- `songUrl` accepts any URL, including streaming embeds — a copyright/ToS
  risk at commercial scale; needs a self-hosted short-clip flow instead.
- `/terms` and `/refunds` are placeholder pages, not real policies —
  Razorpay will require real ones for KYC approval.
- Resend env vars unset by default — manual requests still save fine,
  they just won't email the owner until `RESEND_API_KEY` /
  `RESEND_TO_EMAIL` / `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` are set.
- Add rate-limiting on `POST /api/orders` and `POST /api/manual-requests`
  to stop spam.
- Add a cron/edge function to expire `draft` orders older than ~24h.
