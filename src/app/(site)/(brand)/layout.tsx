 * Layout for autumn-themed public pages and builders.

 * These pages share the landing page's painterly look, so this nested route
 * group imports the same stylesheet once and wraps every brand page in the
 * `.sp-landing` theme scope with the ambient falling-leaves layer. This route
 * group is invisible to the URL, so pages still resolve at /about, /contact,
 * /examples, and /builder. The shared Nav and font variables come from the
 * parent (site) layout; the Nav switches to autumn chrome from its pathname.
